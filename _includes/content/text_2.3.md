As expected, leverage decreases as (on average) the amount of donations/budget increases. Note that all users categories except for the whales are better off (i.e. above the overall Epoch 5 leverage of 17x). The leverage is lower in Epoch 5 due to higher amount of donations, which is a consequence of using the relative QF mechanism.
