If we had to come up with a number, the net effect of the Raffle can be estimated at 0.06 ETH of additional donations.

Interesting stuff: Only 46% of users who signed up to the Raffle did their allocation in AW5 (69% were eligible). Ca. 45 addresses signed up for the Raffle despite not being Octant users anymore (participated in Epochs 1-4, but no longer eligible to participate in Epoch 5).
